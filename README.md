# Todo List Application Using React.js + TypeScript

This is a simple single page todo list application made with React.js and TypeScript.
Styling done with vanilla CSS using BEM and tons of patience.
State management is handled with the useReducer hook.

# Guide

Project: A project is basically a list of todos. Click on a project's name on the left to view its todo items. You can have multiple projects and their todos are exclusive to them. Add projects by clicking on "Add project..." in the sidebar on the left-hand side. "My Project" is the default project and is initialized at every run. (forgot to add function for removing projects. will add soon)

Todo: Todos are todo list items. Add todo items by clicking on the "Add todo..." button. You will be redirected to a page where you can describe your todo item. Click on the checkbox to signify them as complete. Additionally, you can click on the todo item name to edit/view its details. Remove todos by pressing on the red X button on its right.
